How to Run Project Code

Download the data from here:
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
and save the csv as "data.csv". 

Then, open the project code and read in data.csv by using either the file upload cell in Google Colab, or by using pandas.read_csv(). 

The code should then run non-stop until the end.
